### General Questions

	Good place to place general questions and mark assumptions on the general functional spec of the application these 
	should be brought up with the client and clarified as well as documented here.

1. Is load screen really meant to be a progress bar? iOS load screens are static images.
2. Should the app support landscape mode? - Expecting no
don't display anywhere in current design mockups. This also doesn't specify if the matched username belongs to the user.
3. What happens when user is not connected to network?

### Minimum requirements for iOS App
	Supported devices/os versions should be listed here
- iOS 4
